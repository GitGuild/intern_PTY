# Summary  

The Git Guild publishes open source documents and software, with full credit given to the contributors. This is an opportunity for interns to work in an exciting field, and to build their resumes. Furthermore, the program allows interns to earn pay, as well as full promotion to Git Guild membership.

### Roles

+ Intern Manager
+ Intern

The Intern Manager will be responsible for onboarding and supervising the interns. This may require some technical or on-the-job training, and will certainly involve assigning and reviewing tasks. Intern Managers must host at least 2 scrum meetings a week, to keep interns on track.

Each Intern will need to be approved by the Intern Manager, and will be assigned tasks based on their abilities. Interns must attend scrums, and are responsible for completing tasks assigned to them.

### Tasks & Deliverables

Interns with at least partial college education should be capable of editing and testing many types of contributions. Additionally, as the interns are likely to be sourced from academia, we're likely to be able to find research experience and various technical skills like film and design.

 + Editing copy for websites and blog posts (English & Spanish)
 + Test and edit technical specifications (i.e. software functional and
design specs)
 + Testing software for bugs, and writing bug reports
 + Researching new markets and technologies w/ written reports
 + Economic analysis of new assets and business models
 + Filming various presentations, webinars, training sessions, and PR
pieces for syndication
 + creating digital media for websites and/or social media syndication

For the Git Guild itself, the deliverables will be tasks done.

# Economics  

* Note that 1 TGG currently equals US$1 *

### Funding

2000 TGG

The seed funding for the internship program will come from Tigo CTM and isysd (a.k.a. the Creditors). Each agrees to contribute 1000 TGG, and asks to be paid back in full before July 1 2017. Additionally, each requests to be paid 5 TGG per month, per intern.
 
### Costs

The monthly rate for [Workings](http://workingspty.com/) was used for cost estimation, but no office is determined, as yet.

 - $250/mo for Intern Manager office
 - $250/mo per intern for office

##### Surpluses and Deficits    

These costs are to be covered in an "overhead" line item of $350/intern/mo. This is not guaranteed to be paid for each intern, but also includes some buffer. With those revenues and the costs outlined above, the program will break even with 3 (round up from 2.5) fully operating interns.

```
i * 350 = 250 + i * 250
i * 100 = 250
i = 2.5
```

If the program is unable to break even for any month, it is allowed to draw from the funding that the Creditors provided. This balance is still expected to be paid back from surplus in future months. Until such a deficit is paid back, 100% of overhead must go to costs or paying back the deficit.  

If the program is running a surplus, both month over month, and with regard to the Creditors, then excess overhead funds are to be split monthly, evenly between the Intern Manager(s) and Creditor(s), each receiving 50%. For example, if there is a 100 TGG surplus, the Creditors will receive 50 TGG, and the Intern Manager receives 50 TGG.

### Revenues

Ongoing funding for the internship program will come from contributing to Git Guild tasks and earning TGG. By structuring payments to take care of all stakeholders, this program should function quite efficiently and beneficially. Stakeholders are paid on a monthly basis, in tiers.

The fixed payout tiers are:

1. 350 TGG - overhead
2. 10 TGG - Creditors

After these are satisfied for the month, the Intern and Intern Manager split any remaining earnings. At first, the Intern Manager receives 75%, but eventually this reduces to 10%. The full pay table follows, all amounts in TGG.

### Wallets and Keys

##### Management Wallet

2 of 3 TGG using [Copay for colored coins](http://copay.coloredcoins.org/)

The Management Wallet will hold all of the overhead and general funding for the internship program. The signers will be the Intern Manager and the Creditors, with the Creditors each electing 1 signer.

##### Intern Wallets

2 of 3 TGG using [Copay for colored coins](http://copay.coloredcoins.org/)

Interns will be set up with their own wallets for intra-monthly use. They will earn TGG to the wallet, and at the end of the month, cash the balance out with the assistance of the Intern Manager.

The signers will be the Intern, the Intern Manager, and one signer elected by the Creditors.

# Graduation

Interns graduate from the program upon earning 10,000 TGG. At this stage, they are considered full Git Guild Members, and according to the charter, will be given the rank of Journeyer.
